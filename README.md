# ANN-practice-implementation

This repo is about my practice implementation of Artificial Neural Networks with MNIST hand written digit dataset.

The first folder is about practice implementation of multi-class classification with ANN on keras built-in hand written MNIST dataset. The implementations are both with TensorFlow and Pytorch. In this multi-class classification of hand written digits, the predicted-labels VS true-labels are evaluated with `Confusion Matrix table`, and the predicted results are shown in `True-classified Examples` and `Misclassified Examples`.

The scond folder is about practice implementation of regression example with ANN on synthesis data- $$ y = \cos(2x_1) + cos(3x_1) $$ , and make same surface plot with this math equation(synthesis data) by using ANN.
